Python (deep learning and machine learning) for EEG signal processing on the example of recognizing the disease of alcoholism
=====================

Please read full explanation in the paper -

I used dataset from this site - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database , but in finally i convert the dataset to the next file - "Data_after_convert.csv"
