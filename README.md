#### How it works 
Full explanation in the paper - [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344827354_Python_deep_learning_and_machine_learning_for_EEG_signal_processing_on_the_example_of_recognizing_the_disease_of_alcoholism_arXiv201011667_eessSP)

I used dataset from this site - [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database)


but in finally I convert the dataset to the next file - 
["Data_after_convert.csv" ](https://github.com/Ildaron/3.eeg_recognation/blob/master/Data_after_convert.csv)

Recognition of alcoholism due to EEG signals, by - machine learning and deep learning, Python
