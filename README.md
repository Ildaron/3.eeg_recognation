Python (deep learning and machine learning) for EEG signal processing on the example of recognizing the disease of alcoholism
=====================

Full explanation in the paper [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/344827354_Python_deep_learning_and_machine_learning_for_EEG_signal_processing_on_the_example_of_recognizing_the_disease_of_alcoholism_arXiv201011667_eessSP)

I used dataset from this site - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/eeg+database , but in finally i convert the dataset to the next file - "Data_after_convert.csv" 

Recognition of alcoholism due to EEG signals, by - machine learning and deep learning, Python
